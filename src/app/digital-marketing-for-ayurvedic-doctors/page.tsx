        question: "How does digital marketing for Ayurvedic doctors help in reaching modern patients?",
        answer: "Modern patients are searching for holistic and root-cause solutions for chronic issues. Digital marketing ensures that when they search for 'natural treatment for [Condition]' or 'Ayurvedic doctor for PCOD', your clinic appears as a trusted, scientific, and authoritative choice."
    },
    {
        question: "Is content marketing important for an Ayurvedic practice?",
        answer: "It is the most important tool. Ayurveda requires educating the patient on Prakriti, Doshas, and lifestyle. High-quality blogs and videos that explain these concepts in simple, modern terms build immense trust and position you as a knowledgeable guide rather than just a product seller."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the role of Local SEO for Ayurvedic clinics?",
        answer: "Since Ayurvedic treatments often involve multiple visits or therapies like Panchakarma, patients prefer local providers. Ranking for 'Ayurvedic clinic near me' ensures you capture the high-intent local audience who are ready to start their healing journey."
    },
    {
        question: "Should Ayurvedic doctors use social media?",
        answer: "Instagram and Facebook are excellent for sharing daily health tips, seasonal Ritucharya advice, and patient transformation stories. It keeps your practice 'top-of-mind' for people looking to improve their lifestyle naturally."
    },
    {
        question: "How can I build trust online as an Ayurvedic practitioner?",
        answer: "Build trust through 'Evidence of Expertise'. This includes sharing patient video testimonials (with consent), explaining the science behind Ayurvedic herbs, and showcasing your clinical qualifications. Scientific Ayurveda is the most trusted brand online."
    },
    {
        question: "Does digital marketing help in selling Ayurvedic products?",
        answer: "While we focus on clinical consultations, a strong digital brand automatically increases trust in your prescribed medications or customized products. It moves you from being a generic seller to a trusted medical advisor."

                        <p className="mb-6">
                            In a world increasingly looking for natural and holistic healing, <strong>digital marketing for Ayurvedic doctors</strong> is the art of making ancient wisdom discoverable to the modern search-engine user. It is the process of building an authoritative digital brand that positions the Ayurvedic practitioner as a scientific, ethical, and result-oriented healthcare provider.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-6">
                            For an Ayurvedic doctor, digital marketing is more than just advertising; it is 'Arogya Education'. It involves using digital tools—like websites, SEO, and social media—to provide health clarity to a community that is often confused by generic wellness advice.

                        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-16 mb-6">How Patients Search for Ayurvedic Treatments</h2>
                        <p className="mb-6">
                            Ayurvedic patients are predominantly 'Root-Cause' searchers. They are often patients who have tried conventional medicine for chronic issues and are now searching for sustainable alternatives. Their searches include queries like "natural cure for hair fall", "Ayurvedic management of obesity", or "Panchakarma benefits."
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-6">
                            Trust in Ayurveda is built through 'Clarity of Concept'. Patients look for doctors who can explain their condition through a holistic lens without being overly abstract. They look for clinics with a high local ranking and positive patient reviews that mention long-term relief rather than just a quick fix.
